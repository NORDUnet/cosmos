Cosmos install/delete configuration files on the system and execute
custom-written scripts to perform sysadmin tasks.  Cosmos is intended
to be used with a central version controlled repository that hold the
Cosmos "model" file hierarchy for a particular machine.

Cosmos configuration file lives in /etc/cosmos/cosmos.conf by default.
You may use the COSMOS_CONF_DIR to specify a separate configuration
directory, which should contain cosmos.conf and the various *.d
sub-directories.

The default place for the Cosmos "model" hierarchy is
/var/cache/cosmos.  It is specified in cosmos.conf by setting the
COSMOS_MODEL environment variable.  You may also override it using the
--root (or -r for short) on the command line.

To understand what Cosmos helps you with, consider a system tree
structure like this:

   /etc/cosmos/cosmos.conf
   /var/cache/cosmos/overlay/root/.ssh/foobar
   /var/cache/cosmos/delete/etc/somewhere/file-to-be-removed

The cosmos.conf file contains this:

COSMOS_MODEL=/var/cache/cosmos
COSMOS_ROOT=/

The content of the two other files are irrelevant here.

The /var/cache/cosmos/overlay/root/.ssh/foobar file holds a SSHD file
to be installed as /root/.ssh/foobar.  (In this example I'm not using
'.authorized_keys' as an example to avoid accidental overwrites when
you test configurations.)

The /var/cache/cosmos/delete/etc/somewhere/file-to-be-removed is a
placeholder file to indicate that the file
/etc/somewhere/file-to-be-removed should be removed.  Below we'll
assume that you have a real file /etc/somewhere/file-to-be-removed on
your system that should be removed.

You can dry-run cosmos by using --dry-run (or -n for short).  In this
setup it would print the following.  It doesn't do anything!  No files
are removed and nothing is rsync'ed.

root@latte:~# cosmos -n apply
rm -f "/"/"./etc/somewhere/file-to-be-removed"
rsync --archive /var/cache/cosmos/overlay/ /
root@latte:~# 

This mode is not as useful as it could be, because you only see the
rsync command and not what it would do.  To run cosmos in a semi-dry
mode, which will invoke rsync in dry mode, there is the --dry-tasks
(or -N for short).

root@latte:~# cosmos -N apply
rm -f "/"/"./etc/somewhere/file-to-be-removed"
sending incremental file list
root/.ssh/
root/.ssh/foobar

sent 89 bytes  received 20 bytes  218.00 bytes/sec
total size is 4  speedup is 0.04 (DRY RUN)
root@latte:~# 

If you think the output from the dry runs looks harmless, you can run
it for real.  Here the --verbose (or -v fort short) mode is enabled,
otherwise the command is silent.

root@latte:~# cosmos -v apply
40delete: Removing './etc/somewhere/file-to-be-removed'
60overlay: Invoking rsync --archive -v /var/cache/cosmos/overlay/ /
sending incremental file list
root/.ssh/
root/.ssh/foobar

sent 133 bytes  received 36 bytes  338.00 bytes/sec
total size is 4  speedup is 0.02
root@latte:~# 

This illustrate the fundamental task that cosmos does.
