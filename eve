Usage: eve [OPTION...] COMMAND [COMMAND-OPTION...]

Eve is meant for system administrators who wants to centralize and
automate system configuration and package installation.

The COMMAND specify the action sequence performed by the tool.
Currently COMMAND may be 'apply'.

Common options:

  -n, --dry-run             do nothing except explain what should be done
  -N, --dry-tasks           dry run but rsync/tasks are invoked in dry mode
  -h, --help                show this help text and exit
  -V, --version             show version information and exit
  -v, --verbose             explain what is being done

The environment variable EVE_CONF_DIR specify the location of a
configuration file (defaults to /etc/eve/eve.conf) which is read
before command line parameters are parsed.
